# PAO Card Memory Trainer

A web-based application to help you memorize a deck of cards using the Person-Action-Object (PAO) system, a powerful memory technique used by memory athletes.

## What is PAO?

PAO is a memorization system where:

- Each group of three cards represents a scene
- The scene consists of a Person performing an Action with an Object
- This creates vivid, memorable images that are easier to recall than abstract card numbers

## How it Works

1. Each group of 3 cards corresponds to:

   - First card = Person
   - Second card = Action
   - Third card = Object

2. Example Scene:
   ```
   Cards: Ace of Spades (AS), King of Hearts (KH), Queen of Diamonds (QD)
   Scene: Albert Einstein juggling glowing lightbulbs
   - Person: Albert Einstein (AS)
   - Action: Juggling (KH)
   - Object: Glowing lightbulb (QD)
   ```

## Memory Techniques

### Creating Memorable Scenes

1. Make scenes vivid and outrageous
2. Use all your senses when visualizing

4. Link scenes together in a journey

### Practice Tips

1. Start with one card group at a time

## Example PAO Systems

Here are some example associations from the trainer:
